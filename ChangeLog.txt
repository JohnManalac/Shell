Version 0.2 

    Date: 12/11/2022

    Changes: 

        - save_command now loops up to and INCLUDING cmd-index,
          allowing the saved destination to properly be NULL-terminated,
          fixing the bug with intermixed input, output, and pipes When
          calling any command with an extra parameter. 
        - print_prompt now prints a simple shell prompt if any of
          the get environment or directory calls fail. 
        - init_shell and exit_shell both now print leading new line 
          in a separate printf call to allow string literals in 
          subsequent calls to be lined up exactly as their output 
          will appear on screen.
